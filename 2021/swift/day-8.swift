     Operations:

     1. Look for 1, 4, 7, 8
     2. Identify 9 by, joining 7 with 4 and find a 6 segment that contains all bars
     3. Identify 0 by 9 - (6 segments) such that intersecting with 1 has 0 members
     4. 6 is only 6 segment left
     5. Identify 3 by (5 segments) - 1, such that it keeps 3 segments
     6.Â From 5 segments, remove common with 4, 5 has 2 segments and is not 3, 2 has 3 segments
