## Solving Day 1

To find the fuel required for a module take its mass:

- divide by three,
- round down,
- and subtract 2.

---

<Highlighter language="rust" >
{`pub fn calc_fuel_for_mass(mass: i32) -> i32 {
    (mass / 3) - 2
}`}
</Highlighter>

---

## The input

Text file with the mass of each module on each line:

<Highlighter language="text">
{`143843
144558
116244
58650`}
</Highlighter>


---

<Highlighter language="rust">
  {`pub fn solve_day_one(filename: &str) -> i32 {
    let masses = fs::read_to_string(filename).expect("Error reading input");
    
    masses
        .split_terminator("\\n")
        .map(|mod_mass| mod_mass.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
        .fold(0, |acc, mod_mass| {
            acc + day_one::calc_fuel_for_mass_and_fuel(mod_mass)
        })
}`}
</Highlighter>

---

<p style={{textAlign:'center', padding:'2em'}}>
  What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your
  spacecraft?
</p>


---

<p  style={{padding:'2em'}}>

Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module. 

However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on.

</p>

----

<p style={{padding:'2em'}}>
    What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?
</p>
